# 🎮 Game Data Analysis – Practice Project

## 📘 Project Overview:
This is a beginner-level data analysis project built for practice using a small dataset related to a game scenario. The dataset includes information such as guessed players, winners, and outcomes. The objective was to perform basic data cleaning, filtering, and simple analysis using Excel and Python (Pandas).

---

## 📁 Files Included:

- `game_data.xlsx` – Raw dataset containing player guesses, winners, points, etc.
- `game_analysis.ipynb` – Jupyter notebook for analysis using Pandas

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used:

### ✅ Excel:
- Removed blank cells and duplicate rows
- Performed quick filters and counts

### ✅ Python (Pandas):
- Imported and explored dataset
- Cleaned column names and missing data
- Performed group-by analysis (e.g. winners by round)
- Applied filtering and conditional logic
- Used basic stats to find most frequent winners or guesses

---

## 📊 Key Insights:

- ✅ Identified top 3 most guessed players
- 🥇 Found the player with highest win count
- 🔁 Analyzed how many times a specific player was guessed but didn’t win
- 📈 Simple visualizations like bar plots (optional)

---

## 🎯 Learning Outcomes:

- Practiced real-world file handling (Excel to Python)
- Strengthened knowledge of `Pandas` functions like:
  - `read_excel`, `groupby`, `value_counts`, `loc`, `isnull`, etc.
- Applied logical thinking on a fun dataset

---

## ✅ How to Run:

1. Open `game_data.xlsx` to view the raw dataset
2. Run `game_analysis.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab
3. Review outputs and play around with your own questions on the data
